# Life Expectancy and GDP
Welcome to my Life Expectancy and GDP Analysis Project! In this Jupyter notebook, I'll delve into the intriguing relationship between Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and life expectancy for six countries. Leveraging data sourced from the World Health Organization and the World Bank, I'll embark on a journey of data analysis, visualization, and exploration to uncover meaningful insights.

## Project Overview

This notebook is organized into several sections:

1. **Importing Libraries**: Begin by importing the necessary Python libraries for data analysis and visualization.

2. **Read Data**: Load the provided CSV dataset containing information about life expectancy and GDP into a Pandas DataFrame. We'll also inspect the dataset to understand its structure.

3. **Data Wrangling**: Prepare the data for analysis by performing necessary data transformations. This includes converting categorical variables, renaming columns, and adding calculated columns.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Dive into the data by generating summary statistics to gain insights into the dataset's central tendencies and variations.

5. **Data Visualization**: Visualize the relationship between GDP and life expectancy using various plots. We'll explore trends, correlations, and distributions across the selected countries.

6. **GDP and Life Expectancy Growth Analysis**: Analyze the growth of GDP and life expectancy over a specific period for each country, highlighting significant trends.

Let's embark on this data analysis journey and uncover the fascinating connections between GDP and life expectancy!
